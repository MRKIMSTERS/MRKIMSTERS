### Hi there, I'm MRKIMSTERS 👋

<!-- About Me -->
I'm a passionate developer who loves building innovative projects, from cosmic-themed systems to interactive bots. My coding journey kicked off with JavaScript and Node.js, inspired by creating dynamic and automated solutions. I’ve worked on projects like a TypeScript/Javascript-based system for the Astral Express, blending creativity with technical precision.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into Developing/Contributing Cassidy Spectra!. I enjoy experimenting with modern tools and frameworks to craft efficient, user-friendly projects, often with a sprinkle of cosmic flair.
